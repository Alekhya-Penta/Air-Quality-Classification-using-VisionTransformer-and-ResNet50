Good (0-50): Air quality is considered satisfactory and air pollution poses little or no risk.

Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150): Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects, but the general public is unlikely to be affected.
Unhealthy (151-200): Some members of the general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
Very Unhealthy (201-300): Health alert: The risk of health effects is increased for everyone.
