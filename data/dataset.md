# Data Collection

The Dataset is obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains images of Air Pollution for different cities in India and Nepal. The dataset is divided into two folders: Combined_Dataset and Country_wise_Dataset. Total number of image dataset: 12,240 Image size: 224*224.

Air Quality Index (AQI) Class and its defination used in the dataset. There are a total of six classes of Air Pollution, which we represent in our dataset as follows:

Good (0-50): Air quality is considered satisfactory and air pollution poses little or no risk.

Moderate (51-100): Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants, there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.

Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150): Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects, but the general public is unlikely to be affected.

Unhealthy (151-200): Some members of the general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.

Very Unhealthy (201-300): Health alert: The risk of health effects is increased for everyone.

Hazardous/Severe (301-500): Health warning of emergency conditions: Everyone is more likely to be affected.
