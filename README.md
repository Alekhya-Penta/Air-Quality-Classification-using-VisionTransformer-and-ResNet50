# Air-Quality-Classification-using-VisionTransformer-and-ResNet50

Air pollution is a major environmental and public health concern, linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Traditional air quality monitoring relies on ground sensors and statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. Deep learning models like CNNs, Transformers, and hybrids improve air quality classification but face challenges like high computational complexity and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid ViT-ResNet50 model, combining ResNet50's spatial feature extraction with ViT's global attention for enhanced accuracy and robustness. Using an air pollution image dataset from India and Nepal, the ViT-ResNet50 model outperforms ViT, ResNet50, and CNN-LSTM. This confirms its effectiveness for air quality classification, making it a promising solution for real-time and scalable air quality monitoring.
